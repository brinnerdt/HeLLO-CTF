There are two threat models: with oracle and with no oracle.

For "with oracle" mode, the attacker can access both the locked design netlist and oracle.
For "with no oracle" mode, the attack can access only the locked design netlist.

1. The locked circuits are in directory ./locked_circuit/ in BENCH format.
	a. The key inputs names are in format of "keyinput_<index>"
	b. The rest inputs are primary inputs
2. (With oracle mode only) The original circuits are in direcotory ./original_circuit/ as executable binary files.
  If the original circuit has 10 input bits, then the way to execute the oracle is
	e.g.,	./<oracle_name> 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0
	a. The first part is the path to the specific oracle
	b. The rest part is the input pattern in binary, each bit is separate with " " (an empty space)
	c. The output of the oracle is the output values for given input pattern
3. There are 3 locked designs, sharing with the different oracles (with oracle model only) as shown in ./original_circuit/ directory.
